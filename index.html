                <p>Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just trying to think of a good headline
                    for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great to just skip
                    that?</p>

            <div class="background2">
                <p>This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own projects. We
                    were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with any
                    headlines, titles or subject lines.</p>

                <p>We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got amazing results. Some
                    headlines even doubled the initial conversion rates!</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret”
                        collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw
                        some <span>very positive</span> results with these headlines as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to
                        share our collection of <span>200 headlines</span> with everyone.</p>
